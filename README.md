# PushSwap_42

Validated : 90%

This project is centered around sorting algorithms. You will have to sort, with a limited amount of instructions, a list of numbers (the goal being to sort that list with as few moves as possible). 

Thus, push_swap will help you learn about the basic, and more complex, algorithms (quicksort, bubblesort, etc.). For more information, don't hesitate to consult my Doc.pdf available in this repository.
